# AsniSkeletonKeyDB
Tools for working with the skeletonKey DATs

## Main Aims
* Fix/sanitize all DAT xml data
* Parse data into a SQLite database (for use in other applications)
* Export a corrected set of new archived DAT files of use within skeletonKey


The skeletonKey project has been created by romjacket and is available here:  https://github.com/romjacket/skeletonKey
It is unified interface for ROMs, emulators and frontends, but what really interests me is the amazing work done collating the DAT file it uses.
